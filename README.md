# Concrete Ingesters ACE Event Extraction

```
git clone 
mvn package
If using language = ar, make sure to download the ar model from "" and update the main function.
```

A more complete version of Xiao Liu's concrete-ingesters-acex3 java toolkit, which was originally modified from jhu's [concrete-ingesters-acere](https://www.mvnrepository.com/artifact/edu.jhu.hlt/concrete-ingesters-acere).

Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.lx865712528</groupId>
    <artifactId>concrete-ingesters-acex3</artifactId>
    <version>2.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Specially for time2norm data splits.

This version will parse each trigger as an argument with "TRIGGER".

All values and times are extracted at the same time.

# Specifications to run this code:
mvn clean & mvn install should install all java tools dependencies. To run the main class in edu.bit.nlp.concrete.ingesters.acex3AceApf2Concrete, pass in the following arguments:
* Root directory of the remaining file/directory paths
* Directory where json files are to be saved
